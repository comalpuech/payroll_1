## Introduction - Extension Exercise
This is the first installment of a Payroll Application that will be incrementally built over the next 4 weeks.
You have been provided only the skeleton code for the classes plus a test driver in Main Class. The UML Class
diagram provided on Canvas will help create the basic classes required for this application
> If you are unfamiliar with UML Class Diagrams (UML === Unified Modelling Language) then refer to the **UML Class Diagram Essentials** on Canvas - Activity 1.3

## Activity - Develop the Payroll Application.

1. First you will need to clone this repository - use IntelliJ IDEA or if you are confident with Git you could do this clone at a Git bash terminal --> Clone Respository and use the HTTPS address from this repository - https://github.com/cab302-qut/CAB302_P1_Shapes_OOP.git
2. Implement the solution defined by the UML Class Diagram
3. Make sure to read the README file which contains some additional information which you may access here on the Repository or from the cloned repository on your desktop using IntelliJ IDEA

There are some classes that do not require any changes: **DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING 3 CLASSES**
1. **Main Class** - this is a driver program and will test your implementation to ensure that it is correct.
2. **ShapeType Class** - This is a simple class to provide enumerated types for the 2D Shape Objects.
3. **Point Class** - This class models a simple cartesian coordinate in 2 Dimensional space (x,y).

## Important Notes
+ **Main** and **ShapeType** class are not shown in the UML Class diagram as they are only provided to test your implementation of the Shape2D class it's subclasses.
+  The relationship between Shape2D and Point class is a dependency - Shape2D relies on the Point class as Point objects are required by the Shape2D class. The dotted line and open arrow states that Shape2D relies on Point (but Point does NOT rely on Shape2D).
+ Circle, EquilateralTriangle, and Rectangle are all subclasses of Shape2D which is an abstract class. These three (3) classes inherit from Shape2D
+ Square class is a subclass of Rectangle. Square class inherits from Rectangle.
+ All of the concrete shape classes (Circle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle, and Square) are examples of inheritance.

Ideally you would test your implementation in an incremental fashion using Test Driven Development (TDD) - this entails wrioting unit tests to ensure that the code you implmenmet is correct. As we have not yet covered TDD we will use a simple methodology to ensure the application performs as expected. Use the notes in QUT Canvas to work through the classes. All the required formulas and essential logic is desacroibed in detail. If there are any sections that are not clear, please ask your tutor(s) for guidance.
The UML Class Diagram only describes the public methods and the instance variables required by the classes - you are welcome to add in additional private helper methods to reduce any code duplication.
This is a menu driven application and ideally you should validate all user input - this is an aspect that you can always implement later. Having the classes working correctly is far more important. In addition, there is a lot of validation already implemented for you in the **Main** class.

**The most important aim is to get your software solution working. You can always come back and refactor your code to reduce code duplication and to improve the overall structure. We recommend to do incremenetal development - work on a single class at a time starting with the easy classes amd working your way to the more difficult classes. The order of classes we would recommend is:
1. **Point** class is complete however make sure to read the comments amd source code so you understand the purpose of the class.
2. **Shape2D** class would be the first class to attempt - this is an abstract class. Declare all the required private instance variables and the public getters, as well as the constructor for the class. Even though the **Shape2D** class is abstract it can have a constructor which it does. We cannot create an object from this abstract class but you can create its object by reference to it's child classes (EquilateralTriangle, Circle, Rectangle). When creating the conmstructors for the classes that extend the Shape2D abstract class make sure to call **_super()_** in the constructors.
3. **Circle**, **EquilateralTriangle**, and **Rectangle** would be the next three classes to complete - follow the notes in Canvas as the required formulas for area, perimeter and how to determine if a point exists within the shape is explained in detail.
4. Finally complete the **Square** class.

## Testing
Use the sample 2D Shape Program Output provided in Canvas and compare your output with the provided sample output. As previously stated make sure to build this application incrementally - build the project often and ensure that there is not a large accumulation of errors. Make sure the code essentially builds as you would expect. If you implemen t all the classes without some sanity checks through the development process, such as building the project successfully, then you will have a major debugging nightmare to deal with. Comparing test output with output from your implementation is **_NOT_** a robust methodology for assessment of implementation correctness. It is by no means an elegant methodology, however, until we cover Unit Testing this will be sufficient.

## Solutions
Once all the tutorials have been completed for the week the solution will be provided. The solution will be provided as:
1. Respository which may be cloned from GitHub
2. A video walkthrough explaining the implementation of all the classes

## FINAL NOTE
There are no silly questions in this unit - if there is a concept you do not understand then please ask your tutor to explain the concept for you. Our tutors are all experienced and well versed in the Java Language and will be able to assist you. If you have a question you can be sure that other students have the exact same questions.
OOP is an essential requirement that you must master and be part of your programming repertoire. Understanding the four pillars of OOP and the advantages they offer is crucial:
+Code reusability
+Improved [rpoductivity
+Improved quality (mainly through code reuse)
+Scalability
+Improved security through data hiding
+Model real world and abstract entities and allow them to interact to solve real problems
+By using inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes.

OOP is an important skill to acquire and to understand, however, equally it is not suitable for all problem domains. It does take some time to master OOP and the best advice we can give to programming students is simple.....
**Write code, write code, write code, write code........** You cannot break anything so experiment with the code we provide and extend it, change it, try alternatives. Only by writing code and attempting various techniques will you learn the benefits of OOP as well as the limitations.
